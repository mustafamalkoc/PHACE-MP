#  PHACE: Phylogeny-Aware Detection of Molecular Coevolution


The coevolution trends of amino acids within or between genes offer valuable insights into protein structure and function. Existing tools for uncovering
coevolutionary signals primarily rely on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), often neglecting considerations of phylogenetic relatedness and shared 
evolutionary history. 

Here, we present a novel approach based on the substitution mapping of amino acid changes onto the phylogenetic tree. We categorize 
amino acids into two groups: 'tolerable' and 'intolerable,' assigned to each position based on the position dynamics concerning the observed amino acids. 
Amino acids deemed 'tolerable' are those observed phylogenetically independently and multiple times at a specific position, signifying the position's 
tolerance to that alteration. Gaps are regarded as a third character type, and we only take phylogenetically independent altered gap characters into 
consideration. 

Our algorithm is based on a tree traversal process through the nodes and computes the total amount of substitution per branch based on 
the probability differences of two groups of amino acids and gaps between neighboring nodes. To mitigate false coevolution signals from unaligned regions, 
we employ an MSA-masking approach. 

When compared to tools utilizing phylogeny (e.g., CAPS and CoMap) and state-of-the-art MSA-based approaches (DCA, GaussDCA, 
PSICOV, and MIp), our method exhibits significantly superior accuracy in identifying coevolving position pairs, as measured by statistical metrics including 
MCC, AUC, and F1 score. The success of PHACE stems from our capacity to account for the often-overlooked phylogenetic dependency.

PHACE utilizes the original MSA and ML phylogenetic tree to cluster amino acids into "tolerable" and "intolerable" groups, resulting in MSA1. To address issues with gapped leaves and obtain accurate coevolution signals, MSA2 is created to distinguish amino acids from gaps. This information is used to update substitution rates per branch from MSA1. The final MSA is used to construct a matrix detailing changes per branch per position and branch diversity. PHACE score is calculated using a weighted concordance correlation coefficient. (Pos. 126-130, distance: 6.54)

## Input Requirements

To run PHACE, you need:
1. **Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)** in FASTA format
2. **Phylogenetic tree** in Newick format
3. **Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction (ASR)** outputs from IQ-TREE2

For assistance with generating these inputs, please refer to the [PHACT Repository](https://github.com/CompGenomeLab/PHACT).

### Input Format Examples

If you are generating these inputs manually, please ensure that the formats are identical to the examples provided in the `SampleInputData` folder. Each file in that folder represents the correct format and structure expected by PHACE.

#### `SampleInputData/Q5SRN2_MaskedMSA.fasta`
Example MSA file used as input.  

#### `SampleInputData/Q5SRN2.treefile`
Example Newick-format tree.  

#### `SampleInputData/Q5SRN2.state`
Example ASR file (IQ-TREE2 `.state` output).  
This table must have one row per **position × node** combination, and **23 columns** in total:
Use these files to confirm that your own data (MSA, tree, and ASR output) are correctly formatted before running PHACE.


## How to Obtain PHACE Results

Here, we assume you have MSA, a phylogenetic tree, and ASR outputs for the protein of interest.

### Step-by-Step Workflow

#### Step 1: MSA1 Processing

1. **Calculate tolerance scores** per amino acid per position using [ToleranceScore.R](https://github.com/CompGenomeLab/PHACE/blob/main/PHACE_Codes/ToleranceScore.R).

2. **Generate MSA1** using [MSA1.R](https://github.com/CompGenomeLab/PHACE/blob/main/PHACE_Codes/MSA1.R), which comprises three characters:
   - C (dominant amino acids)
   - A (alternate amino acids) 
   - - (gap)

3. **Perform Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction (ASR)** with IQ-TREE2:
   ```bash
   iqtree2 -s ${file_fasta} -te ${file_nwk} -blfix -m Data/vals_MSA1.txt -asr --prefix ${id}_MSA1 --safe
   ```

4. **Construct the initial matrix** using [Part1_MSA1.R](https://github.com/CompGenomeLab/PHACE/blob/main/PHACE_Codes/Part1_MSA1.R) to account for total changes per branch over MSA1.

#### Step 2: MSA2 Processing

1. **Generate MSA2** using [MSA2.R](https://github.com/CompGenomeLab/PHACE/blob/main/PHACE_Codes/MSA2.R), which includes two characters:
   - C (all amino acids)
   - G (gap)

2. **Execute ASR** for MSA2:
   ```bash
   iqtree2 -s ${file_fasta} -te ${file_nwk} -blfix -m Data/vals_MSA2.txt -asr --prefix ${id}_MSA2 --safe
   ```

3. **Develop the secondary matrix** using [Part1_MSA2.R](https://github.com/CompGenomeLab/PHACE/blob/main/PHACE_Codes/Part1_MSA2.R) to identify independent gap alterations.

#### Step 3: Final PHACE Calculation

1. **Merge the matrices** obtained from MSA1 and MSA2 using [GetTotalChangeMatrix.R](https://github.com/CompGenomeLab/PHACE/blob/main/PHACE_Codes/GetTotalChangeMatrix.R).

2. **Execute the final PHACE algorithm** using [PHACE.R](https://github.com/CompGenomeLab/PHACE/blob/main/PHACE_Codes/PHACE.R) to obtain PHACE results.
